<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>This project harnesses the power of SQL to analyze food delivery data and extract valuable insights. 
Utilizing per-order records and descriptive information such as customer code, restaurant ID, order date and time, and more, the analysis paints a clear picture of trends and performance within the food delivery domain. 
Through structured queries executed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), various analytical questions were addressed, such as identifying top-performing outlets, tracking daily new customer counts, and exploring promotional code usage.
